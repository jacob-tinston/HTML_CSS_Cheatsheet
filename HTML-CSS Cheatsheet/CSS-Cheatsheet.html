            <h2>What Is CSS?</h2>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that is used to style HTML and 
                make it look appealing on the browser. It uses tags that are linked to the element
                in a linked HTML file with curly braces that hold the information that affects those 
                HTML elements.

            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <p>CSS syntax is pretty simple. It takes the element/class/id from the html code,
                followed by curly braces ('{}') and the information inside. <br>
                Here is an example: <br>

            <h2>CSS Properties</h2>
            <p>The properties are the parts of CSS that go inside the curly braces. 
                These determine how the program changes the look of the HTML. <br>
                The following is a table of some common CSS properties and their meanings: <br>

            <h2>Semantic CSS</h2>
            <p>Semantic CSS basically just means that the element are named similar to what they represent.
                For example, if there is an &lt;article&gt; element that contains information about cars,
                the class of the article would be non-semantic if it were just named 'code'. <br>
                A semantic class would be 'cars'. Or more specifically, what part of the car the article is
                talking about.
